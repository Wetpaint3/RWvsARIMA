Random walk VS ARIMA model in predicting exchange rates

Back in 1983 two economists Richard Meese and Kenneth Rogoff published paper, where they compare the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of different structural models and time series exchange rate models against Random walk forecasts. They found that a random walk model performs at least as good as any estimated model.
So this research provides the evidence and confirms the stylized fact that exchange rate is basically unpredictable and spot exchange rate follows approximately a random walk.
This work was in certain sense fundamental in macroeconomic analysis. This experiment is pretty straight-forward and at the same time so fundamental and groundbreaking. I liked how authors of this paper approach this problem and how they designed their experiment so I decided to replicate this work in simplified version on my own to see if I will get similar results.
For my case I am going to use just one model, ARIMA, to compare its forecast performance against Random walk.
